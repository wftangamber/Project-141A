Lasso Model Explanation:




Testing: diagnostic....just 1 sample, look for diagnostic plot for glmnet
```{r}
library(ggfortify)
fit <- glmnet::cv.glmnet(x_train, y_train)
autoplot(lasso_mod)



```


# Sensitivity Analysis 
```{r message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Lasso Model Diagnostic
library(plotmo)
plotres(lasso_mod, which = 3) # residual vs. fitted
```

The above Residuals vs. Fitted plot shows a negative linear pattern on its left half while no patterns detected on its right half. Furthermore, there are 3 extreme values present. Therefore, it might be somehow problematic to assume linear relationship between explanatory variables and response variables.

```{r}
plotres(lasso_mod, which = 4) # QQ plot 
```

Since the right end is above the normal line, we have more extreme values than normal distribution for right end, which means that it has heavier tails. The confidence level that we constructed is actually smaller than the designed confidence level. Although the graph shows some level of heavier tails compare to Normal distribution, it is reasonable to assume the normality assumption holds because points locate relatively close to the normal line.

```{r}
# Ridge Model Diagnostic 
plotres(ridge_mod, which = 3)
```

The above Residuals vs. Fitted plot shows a negative linear pattern on its left half while no patterns detected on its right half. Furthermore, there are 3 extreme values present. Therefore, it might be somehow problematic to assume linear relationship between explanatory variables and response variables.

```{r}
plotres(ridge_mod, which = 4)
```

Even though the right tail is above the normal line, most of the residuals approximately follow normal line. Thus, it it reasonable to assume that normality assumption holds.

#Introduction

  The COVID 19 pandemic has created large influences on the economy, education, and healthcare worldwide. With the continuous consequences of the COVID, people are curious about the key factors which affect the infection rate. Under such circumstances, we are motivated to find factors that connect closely to the infection rate of the COVID-19. And making an appropriate prediction model which is generated by the linear lasso model. We choose to use the lasso model in this report because the parameters are relatively small here. And it is good at minimizing prediction errors.
  
  5 datasets are sorted, filtered, and merged to form the final dataset for analysis. The main dataset we are using here is the COVID-19 global data from the World Health Organization(WHO), which is a daily record of the COVID-19 cases and death cases corresponding to countries with the WHO region code. The data is significant since WHO is an official agency of the United Nations (UN), which holds the responsibility of guiding global public health. The other four datasets come from the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP), the University of Oxford, and Kaggle(raw data is from Worldometer).
  
  The WHO dataset contains global data from 2020/01/02 to 2021/03/02, but we only use the data on 2021/03/01 to make an easier manipulation. Also, the WHO region code would be used for continental classification. The key dependent variable in this project is the infected rate for COVID 19 by country. Independent variables we are choosing here are data that can strongly indicate the situation of the population, economy, and health system. The basic unit here is per individual country. And the final data is filtered carefully by the COVID stringency index. 
  
  The results of the report are meaningful because it shows the relationship between the COVID 19 infection rate and the population, economy, health system, along with a relatively accurate prediction.


#Background

  Final dataset is created by the manipulation of merging 5 datasets. The categories of the dataset can be classified mainly as infection, population, region, economy and health system. And there are 153 countries studies in this project.
  
  For the infection, we are looking at the infected rate, it is originally the cumulative infection cases in the WHO data. We transformed the cumulative cases into the infected rate in this report -- infected rate = cumulative cases/popluation of the specific country. We are doing the transformation because we want to minimizing the effect of population base when we are considering the effect of independent variables. It is not fair to compare the infected cases together while the denominator is quite different. For example, if one party has 100 people, and another has 1000 people. Both of them has 50 infected cases for COVID 19. It would be very inappropriate saying that the COVID conditions are the same for the two parties. 
  
  The population is interpreted such by the total population number, land area, population density, urban population percent.
  The region is grouped into 6 WHO region: African Region(AFRO), Region of the Americas(AMRO), South-East Asia Region(SEARO), European Region(EURO), Eastern Mediterranean Region(EMRO), and Western Pacific Region(WPRO).
  
  The economy is interpreted by GDP per capita.
  
  The health system is interpreted by the health expenditure, in % of GDP.
  
  In summary, the final dataset contains:
  
  - infection variable: "infected_rate"
  
  - demography variable: "WHO_region"
  
  - population variable: "Population 2020", "Pop_yearly_change", "Net.Change", "population_density", "land_area", "Migrant_net_change", "Fert_rate", 'median_age", "urban_population_percent"
  
  - economy variable: "GDP_per_capita" 
  
  - health system variable: "health_expenditure_of_GDP"



#Visualization

The first 6 rows and the overall summary of the final data is shown below.

```{r}

```


The cumulative death cases by regions in world map. According to the choropleth map, we can see that the cumulative cases is serious for the African Region, East Asian, and relatively serious for Europe.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
world <- map_data("world")
case.counts <- data4 %>% 
  select(Country, Cumulative_cases) %>%                      
  rename(region = Country, case = Cumulative_cases)
life.exp.map <- left_join(case.counts, world, by = "region")
ggplot(life.exp.map, aes(long, lat, group = group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = case), color = "white")+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C")
```

The Scatter plot below shows the relationship between the GDP and the infected rate, coloring by the groups of WHO regions. According to the plot, we can see that the relationship between the two variables seems positive. Especially for the EURO, AMRO, EMRO region, the higher the GPA per capital, the higher the infected rate.

```{r}
ggplot(d_rate_table, aes(x=GDP_per_capita, y=infected_rate, shape=WHO_region, color=WHO_region)) +
  geom_point()
```

The Scatter plot below shows the relationship between the health expenditure and the infected rate, coloring by the groups of WHO regions. According to the plot, we can see that the relationship between the two variables also seems positive. Especially for the EURO, AMRO, EMRO region, the higher the health expenditure percent of GDP, the higher the infected rate.

```{r}
ggplot(d_rate_table, aes(x=health_expenditure_of_GDP, y=infected_rate, shape=WHO_region, color=WHO_region)) +
